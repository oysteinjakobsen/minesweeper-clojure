# Minesweeper

Played with Clojure for the first time. This is an implementation of the Minesweeper game.
The UI is text based and in a separate module from the core game functionality.

## Usage

Run the game with (minesweeper.repl/play width height number-of-mines) or from the
command-line using the uberjar with the same arguments.
